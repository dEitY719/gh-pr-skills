# shell-common/functions/agy_run.sh
# SSOT for the agy (Antigravity CLI) non-interactive transport.
#
# Why this exists: the same 15 lines were hand-copied into three call sites
# (gh_pr_review.sh, ai_usage.sh, claude_plugins_docs_ko.sh) and had already
# started to drift — one had a `jq` preflight, the others didn't. The shapes
# below were verified against the real CLI, not just `agy --help`:
#   in   {"event":"user","message":{"content":"<prompt>"}}
#   out  {"event":"init",...}
#        {"event":"step_update",...}   (one per turn / tool step)
#        {"event":"result","result":{"status":"SUCCESS","response":"<text>"}}
#
# Two flag facts that cost two bugs to learn, so they live here now:
#  - `agy --print "$prompt"` puts the whole prompt in one argv value, capped
#    by the kernel at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (131072B). Issue #1761: a 62-file PR
#    (131746B) tripped it and produced no review at all.
#  - `--print` still needs a value even in stream-json mode (Go's flag parser
#    rejects a bare `--print` with "flag needs an argument"). Issue #1767: a
#    bare trailing `--print` meant the prompt piped on stdin was never read.
#    So it is passed empty and the stdin message carries the prompt.

# Run agy with the prompt on stdin; print its response text on stdout.
#
# Args: any extra agy flags (e.g. --dangerously-skip-permissions).
# Stdin: the raw prompt text. Stdout: `.result.response` — byte-identical to
# what plain `agy --print <prompt>` used to write, so callers that tee it into
# a file or a comment body need no other change. Stderr is left alone for the
# caller to redirect. Returns agy's own exit code, or 1 when the stream
# carried no SUCCESS result (the exit code alone is NOT the success signal —
# a non-SUCCESS result that still exited 0 would otherwise look like a pass).

    # would lose it, and the caller logs/prints that code verbatim.
